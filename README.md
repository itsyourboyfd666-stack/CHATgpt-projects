# App Store Web Platform

This repository contains the initial planning and architecture notes for a web-based “App Store” platform that showcases external web apps and includes an AI-powered app generator.

## Overview
- **Discover apps:** Browse, search, and filter a catalog of external web apps.
- **Launch safely:** Open apps in new tabs or sandboxed iframes with a safelisted domain policy and CSP.
- **Developer portal:** Submit and manage app listings with review/moderation workflows.
- **AI App Maker:** Generate starter web apps from text prompts, preview them, and publish directly to the store.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for a detailed blueprint and milestones.
